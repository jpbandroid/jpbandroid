Developer of jpbROM, UTE (UltraTextEdit), Windivs, ScratchTappy among others... <br>
I mostly code in Python, Java and C# and also make Scratch projects occasionally (I know, that may sound weird, but I do actually use Scratch). I'm trying to learn C and C++ through my development and maintenence of the Windivs project. <br>
Go ahead and chat to me on Discord using the username jpb_errortek .
